# N & P Badminton Club and Coaching (N&PCC)

## Introduction

The reason I am creating a website for N&PBCC is because they currently only have a facebook page and an instagram page.
The founders are qualified level 2 coaches and run junior and adult coaching sessions, it would make them easier to be found on search engines. reference point for the club members potential to recruit new members grow the club sessions.
There are currently scheduled club night for play sessions and junior coaching session.
It would serve as a place for parents to check when coaching sessions are available.
Possibly create a database to store information of those attending etc... register their interest and also for members to login and see what they've paid for.
